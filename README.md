# README

Super minimal Jekyll boilerplate mostly derived from the super nice documentation from Tania Rascia's ["Make a Static Website with Jekyll"](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/)

## Hopes and dreams

To use this template for quick static web projects with minimal needs

## Setup

see: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/

```bash
# Install Bundler through RubyGems
gem install bundler

# Add Jekyll to your Gemfile and install its dependencies
bundle add jekyll && bundle install

# Create a new Jekyll site at ./myblog
jekyll new myblog

# Change into your new directory
cd myblog

# Build the site on the preview server

# Now browse to http://localhost:4000
```
